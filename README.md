# Game: Rock/ Paper/ Scissor
<dr>
This is a python project in which I build a game of Rock, Paper, Scissor. That you can play with computer.
I use random module for computer's selection, and while loop in which the main body of code is enclosed to
run code recursively and control flow statements for different snerios in game.
I describe only the wining and draw situations of user and leave all the remaining situations on else statement.
And this game also show the total score of user and computer and then also tell who wins the league, means
if user play 5 rounds in which user wins 3 rounds and computer wins 2 rounds, so this league is won
by user.
